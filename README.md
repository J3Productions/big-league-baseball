## Setup

### Install Dependencies

`npm install`

### Run the Game

To run the game, the game will start an Express server hosted locally. To start the server, run the command:

`npm run test`

Once the server is running, view [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your favorite browser to start playing.

### Generate Documentation

To generate the code documentation, simply run:

`npm run doc`

The documentation will then be generated inside the `docs` folder and is accessible from `docs/index.html`.

### Test Suite

This software comes pre-packaged with a self-testing suite. To access the test suite, click on the link at the bottom of the start page, or go to [localhost:3000/test](http://localhost:3000/test) (assuming the server is already running).
